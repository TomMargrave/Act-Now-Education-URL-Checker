## Output and Results

After running the script, you will find two new files in the same folder as the script:

- **urls.csv** â€” Contains all the links extracted from your HTML table.
- **url_validation_report.xlsx** â€” An Excel file with three sheets:
  - **All URL Results**: Every link and its status.
  - **Broken URLs**: Only links that are broken or have errors.
  - **Valid URLs**: Only links that are working.

At the end of the script, you will also see a summary printed in the terminal, for example:
ðŸ“Š URL Validation Summary: 
Total URLs : 452 
Valid URLs : 180 39.82% 
Redirected : 123 27.21% 
Broken URLs : 129 28.54% 
Redirected HTTP: 20 4.42%

**What this means:**
- **Total URLs**: The number of links checked.
- **Valid URLs**: Links that work and return a successful response.
- **Redirected**: Links that automatically send you to a different address.
- **Broken URLs**: Links that do not work or return an error.
- **Redirected HTTP**: Links that were redirected from HTTP to HTTPS.

You can open the Excel file to see detailed results for each link.

## Troubleshooting

- **"python not found" or "pip not found":**  
  Python may not be installed or not added to your PATH. Reinstall Python and check "Add to PATH" during setup.

- **ImportError (e.g., No module named 'openpyxl'):**  
  Run the install command again:
  ```
  pip install openpyxl
  ```

- **Import "openpyxl" could not be resolved from source (Pylance):**  
In VS Code, select the correct Python interpreter:
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type `Python: Select Interpreter`, and choose the one where you installed the packages.

- **Permission denied or file not found:**  
Make sure you are in the correct folder and have permission to read/write files.

- **No table found in the HTML file:**  
Double-check that your `element.html` file contains a `<table>` element. Try copying the table HTML again.

- **Still stuck?**  
- Make sure your input file is named `element.html` and is in the same folder as the script.
- Try running the script as administrator (Windows: right-click Command Prompt > Run as administrator).
